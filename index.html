			<div>
				<p> I am a thoughtful and diligent software engineer who is keen to show off my developing skills. 
					I enjoy making things and experiencing that feel-good factor from successfully delivering a system, 
					knowing I made it and helped fix some business problems.
					<br><br>
					My strongest skills would be problem solving, critical thinking, and solution architecture. 
					I have used many tools and languages across my time at school, university, and in employment. 
					As a result, I have dived into all parts of the software development life cycle, from requirements gathering to maintenance and support.
					<br><br>
					I have two years of experience as a Systems Developer at Six Degrees. 
					I administer and develop their ServiceNow instances by 
					responding to and fixing incidents, dealing with requests, and breaking up enhancements into epics and stories. 
					I have completed a number of projects during my time at Six Degrees.
					<br><br>
					Some of the languages and tools I have experience with include:

				I've won the Above & Beyond Award twice while at Six Degrees. This is an internal award in recognition of employees who have done something outstanding during a given quarter.
