				<p> I'm a creative and inquisitive software engineer who is keen to show off my developing skills. I
					enjoy making things and experiencing that feel-good factor from successfully publishing a project,
					knowing I made and was part of that.
					<br><br>
					I specialise as a Full-Stack Developer primarily with Java, Scala & C#. 
					However, I am also interested in ITSM, UI/UX Design, Data Mining and Functional Software Development.
					<br><br>
					I am currently employed as a ServiceNow Developer for Six Degrees. 
					I administer and develop their ServiceNow platforms by dealing with incidents, requests and enhancements. 
					They are based in St. Katharine Docks, London.

			<p><b>February 2022 to Present | Systems Developer at Six Degrees | St Katherines Dock, London </b>
				<br><br>
				Six Degrees is a cloud-managed service provider. I administrate and develop their ServiceNow platforms. Predominantly, I work on their SecOps ServiceNow instances with the CSOC (Cyber Security Operations Center) leadership team. Together, we enhance the instance to help the experience and efficiency of the SOC (Security Operations Center). Also, I manage the general administration of the platform by dealing with users, permissions, integrations, upgrades, and requests. We work in an agile, feature-driven environment and rely on user acceptance testing to continuously deliver enhancements.
				<br><br>
				I've won the Above & Beyond Award twice while being at Six Degrees. This is an award presented by the CEO in recognition of employees who have done something outstanding during a given quarter. I won it at Christmas time in 2022 due to several successful projects being delivered to their SecOps ServiceNow instance. I won it again in May 2023 after leading and completing the ServiceNow upgrade to the latest release.
				<br><br>
				Finally, on June 2023 I achieved my ServiceNow Certified System Administrator certification by passing the exam and completing all the required prerequisites.

				<b>Running 🏃</b> <br>
				I like staying active by running, and I've done multiple runs for charity. In June 2022, I did the
				<a title="High Elms 10k 2022 results"
					href="https://www.racetimeresult.co.uk/results/high-elms-10k2?fbclid=IwAR2c1OOVnNYkH1o70eBwXoEoYTMxFvkboiZGm9LrpneaXez-ze7y6MsK950"

				<a title="Richmond Runfest Marathon 2022 results"
					href="https://results.racetimingsolutions.co.uk/results.aspx?CId=16269&RId=1520" target="_blank"

				for 
				<a title="Archived gofundme sponsor link" href="https://gofund.me/6ef37a8e" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind UK</a>.
				In December 2022, I dressed up as Santa and completed the Orpington Santa Dash - a 2km fun run through my local town. 
				Most importantly, I got into the London Marathon 2024 via the open ballot, and I am raising money for 
				<a title="London Marathon 2024 Fundrasing for Samaritans" href="https://2024tcslondonmarathon.enthuse.com/pf/richard-woolley" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Samaritans</a>. The run is on the 21st of April 2024.
				<br><br>
				Between these events, I enjoy completing different 
				<a title="My Parkrun stats" href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/parkrunner/7114751/all/" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkruns</a> or going to the gym. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Computer Building 🖥️</b> <br>
				I enjoy learning about computers and their components.

					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom PC</a>
				in 2014, which lasted all through sixth form and university.
				I decided to upgrade to a
				<a title="2022 Build on PCPartPicker.com" href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/b/t7W323" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">newer AMD setup</a> in August 2022.
				This was because I wanted to get into machine learning and simulations.
