				<p> I am a thoughtful and diligent software engineer eager to leverage my developing skills to create effective solutions that address real business challenges.
					I enjoy experiencing that feel-good factor from successfully delivering a system, knowing I have contributed to solving important business problems.
					<br><br>
					My key strengths lie in problem solving, critical thinking, and solution architecture. 
					These skills have developed through my educational background and professional experience.
					I have engaged in every aspect of the software development life cycle, from requirements gathering to maintenance and support.
					<br><br>
					I have two years of experience as a Systems Developer at Six Degrees. 
					In this role, I administer and develop our ServiceNow instances: addressing incidents, handling requests, breaking enhancements into epics and stories, and ultimately completing these stories.
					I have successfully completed multiple projects that have substantially improved operational efficiency and enhanced customer experience.
					<br><br>
					Some of the programming languages, development platforms, tools, and services I have experience with include:
