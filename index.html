				<div>
				  <p>
				  	I'm a creative and energetic software engineering graduate who is keen to show off their developing skills.
				  	Making things and experiencing that feel-good factor upon looking at a project <b>you've</b> been part of, helped fuel me to pursue a career in this field.
						<br><br>
						I specialise as a Full-Stack Developer primarily with C#, Java & Scala, but I am also interested in Data Mining and Functional Software Development.
            <br><br>
						I am currently employed as a software developer for Six Degrees. They are based in St. Katharine Docks, London.
