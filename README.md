# Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ“–

Welcome to Richard's (aka IcecoolR) Portfolio! This repository features my personal website, where I share my work, education, projects, and interests in software engineering.

I built this website from scratch and have been continuously maintaining and developing it since graduating from university in 2020.

Check it out live on [GitHub Pages](https://icecoolr.github.io/Portfolio/)! Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardwoolley1999/).
