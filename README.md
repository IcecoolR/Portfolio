# Richard Woolley â€“ Software Engineer Portfolio ðŸ“–

Welcome to the portfolio of **Richard** (aka **IcecoolR**)! This repository features my personal website, where I showcase my journey as a software engineer, highlighting my projects, skills, education, and personal interests.

I built this website from the ground up after graduating from university in 2020, and Iâ€™ve been continuously enhancing it with new features and improvements ever since. This website reflects my passion for software development and my commitment to ongoing learning.
