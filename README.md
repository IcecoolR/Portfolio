# Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ“–

This repository hosts Richard's (aka IcecoolR) Portfolio, which is a website where I talk about my work/education, projects and interests. 

I created this website from scratch. It has been maintained and developed since I finished university in 2020.

Check it out live on [GitHub Pages](https://icecoolr.github.io/Portfolio/)!
