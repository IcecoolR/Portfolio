# Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ“–

This repository hosts Richard's (aka IcecoolR) Portfolio, which is a website where I talk about my education, projects and interests. <br>
I created this website from scratch and have maintained it since I finished university in 2020. <br> 
Check it out live on [GitHub Pages](https://icecoolr.github.io/Portfolio/)!
